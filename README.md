# PONG-in-RAPTOR
Basic recreation of PONG, an arcade classic developed by ATARI. The recreation was built using RAPTOR, an application used to execute graphically assembled pseudocode. 

This project of mine is open-source

Note: Be sure to unzip the project! 

Audio files will fail to load if 'PONG.rap' is executed within a zipped directory!
